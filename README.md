# SpotiSync
Fun project that's originally made to sync my spotify playlist with my Galaxy Watch for Offline Playback (without actually having Spotify Premium)

# Installation
Download latest release or build one by yourself, and run it via terminal `java -jar SpotiSync-1.0-all.jar`

Very experimental and probably need an adjustment for all your needs. Open PRs are welcome, or just contact me on my discord `ap1p` for Feature Requests
